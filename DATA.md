# Data fields usage in semantic and structured search

## Analysis of Property Fields

Below, I evaluate each field from the `property` object:

1. **id**: `"177020"`
   - **Use**: Structured search (payload for result retrieval).
   - **Reason**: Stored in `payload.id` for unique identification but not used in filters or embeddings.

2. **name**: `"GrandStory Nishiazabu #303"`
   - **Use**: Semantic search.
   - **Reason**: Included in embedding text (`text = f"{prop.name}, ..."`) for queries like "apartments in Nishiazabu." Not filtered structurally.

3. **unit_number**: `"#303"`
   - **Use**: Neither (stored in payload for display).
   - **Reason**: Stored in `payload.unit_number` (implicitly via `name`) but not queried.

4. **building_id**: `"160694"`
   - **Use**: Neither (stored in payload for reference).
   - **Reason**: Administrative field, not used in search.

5. **address**:
   - **full**: `"2-20-11 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo"`
     - **Use**: Semantic and structured search.
     - **Reason**: Included in embedding text for semantic queries (e.g., "Minato-ku apartments"). `payload.ward` (extracted as "Minato-ku") is filtered in structured search (`ward` filter).
   - **latitude**: `35.6617691`
     - **Use**: Structured search (output only).
     - **Reason**: Stored in `payload.latitude` for map display in results, not filtered.
   - **longitude**: `139.7191087`
     - **Use**: Structured search (output only).
     - **Reason**: Stored in `payload.longitude` for map display, not filtered.

6. **area**:
   - **m2**: `94.21`
     - **Use**: Semantic and structured search.
     - **Reason**: Included in embedding text (`Area: {prop.area.m2} m2`) for queries like "spacious apartments." Filtered via `payload.area_m2` (`min_area_m2`).
   - **ft2**: `1014.0`
     - **Use**: Neither.
     - **Reason**: Redundant with `m2`, not used in Japan-focused queries.
   - **price_per_m2**: `7430`
     - **Use**: Neither (potential for structured).
     - **Reason**: Not currently used but could be filtered for cost-efficiency queries.
   - **price_per_ft2**: `690`
     - **Use**: Neither.
     - **Reason**: Redundant with `price_per_m2`.

7. **type**: `"Apartment"`
   - **Use**: Semantic search.
   - **Reason**: Included in embedding text (`Type: {prop.type}`) for queries like "apartments." Not filtered structurally but could be.

8. **floor**: `"3F  (of 0F)"`
   - **Use**: Semantic search.
   - **Reason**: Included in embedding text (`Floor: {prop.floor or 'N/A'}`) for queries like "high-floor apartments." Stored in `payload.floor` for display.

9. **floor_number** (derived from `floor`):
   - **Use**: Structured search.
   - **Reason**: Derived via `parse_floor` in `index_properties.py` and stored in `payload.floor_number`. Filtered for `min_floor` and `max_floor` (e.g., `floor_number >= 2`).

10. **contract**:
    - **length**: `"2 YearsStandard"`
      - **Use**: Structured search.
      - **Reason**: Stored in `payload.contract_length` and filtered for `contract_length` (e.g., "short-term").
    - **type**: `"Standard"`
      - **Use**: Structured search.
      - **Reason**: Stored in `payload.contract_type` and could be filtered, though not currently used in `QueryElements`.

11. **year_built**: `2022`
    - **Use**: Semantic and structured search.
    - **Reason**: Included in embedding text (`Built: {prop.year_built}`) for "new apartments." Filtered via `payload.year_built` (`min_year_built`).

12. **price**:
    - **monthly_total**: `700000`
      - **Use**: Semantic and structured search.
      - **Reason**: Included in embedding text (`Price: Â¥{prop.price.monthly_total}/month`) for "affordable" queries. Filtered via `payload.monthly_total` (`max_price`).
    - **rent**: `680000`
      - **Use**: Neither (potential for structured).
      - **Reason**: Redundant with `monthly_total`, not currently used.
    - **management_fee**: `20000`
      - **Use**: Structured search.
      - **Reason**: Stored in `payload.management_fee` and filtered for `max_management_fee` (e.g., 0 for no fee).
    - **currency**: `"JPY"`
      - **Use**: Neither.
      - **Reason**: Always JPY, not queried.

13. **initial_cost_estimate**:
    - **first_month_rent**: `700000`
      - **Use**: Neither (potential for structured).
      - **Reason**: Not currently used but could be filtered.

14. **requirements**:
    - **japanese_required**: `null` (or `true` in some cases)
      - **Use**: Structured search.
      - **Reason**: Stored in `payload.japanese_required` and filtered for `japanese_required` (e.g., `false` for non-Japanese speakers).
    - **note**: `null` (or text in some cases)
      - **Use**: Neither (potential for semantic).
      - **Reason**: Not used but could be included in embedding if descriptive.

15. **features**:
    - **unit**: `["Pet Friendly(+1 mo deposit)", "Intercom", ...]`
      - **Use**: Semantic and structured search.
      - **Reason**: Included in embedding text (`Features: {', '.join(prop.features.unit + ...)}`) for queries like "pet-friendly." `payload.unit_features` is filtered for `unit_features`, and `pet_friendly` is derived for filtering.
    - **building**: `["Autolock", "Parcel Locker"]`
      - **Use**: Semantic and structured search.
      - **Reason**: Included in embedding text and filtered via `payload.building_features` for `building_features`.

### Explanation of Example Queries
- **Natural Language**: Each query is phrased as a user might express it in a real estate search, avoiding technical terms (e.g., "ID 177020") and focusing on practical needs (e.g., "pet-friendly," "near Omotesando").
- **Hybrid Search**:
  - **Semantic Component**: Queries include terms that match the embedding text (e.g., "Nishiazabu" for `name`, "spacious" for `area.m2`). The LLM extracts `keywords` for vector search.
  - **Structured Component**: Queries trigger specific filters via `QueryElements` (e.g., `max_price: 200000`, `min_floor: 2`). The LLM parses numeric/categorical values for Qdrant filters.
- **Relevance to Tokyo**:
  - Queries reflect Tokyoâs context, using wards (e.g., "Minato-ku"), train lines (e.g., "Odawara Line"), and cultural factors (e.g., "non-Japanese speakers," "no guarantor fee").
  - For example, "not on the first floor" aligns with security concerns for single women, as you mentioned.
- **Potential Fields**: For fields not currently used (e.g., `bedrooms`, `price_per_m2`), queries assume implementation in `QueryElements` and filters, showing how they could be used.
- **Data Limitations**: Some queries (e.g., "near Odawara Line," "two-bedroom") may return no results with your current 3-property dataset due to empty fields (`lines`, `bedrooms`). They are designed to work with a populated dataset (e.g., 3000 properties).
