# fastctl-search

To build a semantic search system for your real estate properties JSON data, we need to design queries that leverage the semantic meaning of user input and match it to relevant property attributes. Semantic search typically involves embedding textual and numerical data into a vector space using models like BERT, Sentence Transformers, or other NLP tools, then retrieving properties based on vector similarity (e.g., cosine similarity). The JSON schema and data provided earlier include fields like `address`, `area`, `price`, `type`, `year_built`, `nearest_stations`, `features`, and `requirements`, which are ideal for semantic search.

Below, I’ll provide examples of semantic search queries tailored to your real estate data, explain how they would work, and suggest how to process them. These examples assume you’ve preprocessed the data (e.g., combining relevant text fields and embedding them) and have a system to handle both semantic (text-based) and structured (numerical/filter-based) queries. I’ll also consider the data’s structure and content, such as the fact that all properties are for rent in Tokyo, Japan, and include fields like `address.full`, `area.m2`, and `nearest_stations`.

### Semantic Search Query Examples

#### 1. Natural Language Query: "Modern apartment near Omotesando with at least 80 square meters"

- **User Intent**: Find a spacious, modern apartment for rent close to Omotesando Station.
- **Relevant Data Fields**:
  - `address.full` (to match location, e.g., "Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo")
  - `nearest_stations.station_name` and `nearest_stations.walk_time_min` (to match "Omotesando Station" and proximity)
  - `area.m2` (to filter for ≥ 80 m²)
  - `year_built` (to infer "modern," e.g., built after 2020)
  - `type` (to ensure it’s an "Apartment")
- **How It Works**:
  - **Text Embedding**: Combine `address.full`, `nearest_stations.station_name`, and `type` into a text string (e.g., "Apartment in Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo near Omotesando Station"). Embed this using a model like `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
  - **Semantic Matching**: Compute cosine similarity between the query embedding ("Modern apartment near Omotesando") and property embeddings. Rank properties by similarity.
  - **Structured Filters**:
    - `area.m2 >= 80`
    - `year_built >= 2020` (assuming "modern" implies recent construction)
    - `nearest_stations.station_name = "Omotesando Station"` and `nearest_stations.walk_time_min <= 15` (for proximity)
  - **Example Match**: Property with `id: "177020"`:
    - Address: "2-20-11 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo"
    - Area: 94.21 m²
    - Nearest Station: Omotesando Station (9 min walk)
    - Year Built: 2022
    - Type: Apartment
    - Monthly Total: 700,000 JPY
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Use a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or Faiss) to store property embeddings for fast similarity search.
  - Apply filters post-semantic search to narrow down results.
  - Boost relevance for properties with closer `walk_time_min` to Omotesando.

#### 2. Query: "Affordable apartment in Shibuya for a non-Japanese speaker"

- **User Intent**: Find a budget-friendly rental in Shibuya-ku that doesn’t require Japanese language skills.
- **Relevant Data Fields**:
  - `address.full` (to match "Shibuya-ku, Tokyo")
  - `price.rental.monthly_total` (to infer "affordable," e.g., below median price)
  - `requirements.japanese_required` (to filter for properties where Japanese is not required)
  - `type` (to ensure it’s an "Apartment")
- **How It Works**:
  - **Text Embedding**: Combine `address.full` and `type` (e.g., "Apartment in Uehara, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo"). Embed query and properties.
  - **Semantic Matching**: Match query embedding ("Affordable apartment in Shibuya") to property embeddings, focusing on Shibuya addresses.
  - **Structured Filters**:
    - `requirements.japanese_required = false` or `requirements = null` (since `null` implies no language restriction in the data)
    - `price.rental.monthly_total <= 300,000 JPY` (assuming "affordable" is below the median of the provided data, where prices range from 190,000 to 700,000 JPY)
    - `address.full` contains "Shibuya-ku"
  - **Example Match**: Property with `id: "171811"`:
    - Address: "2-38-11 Uehara, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo"
    - Monthly Total: 420,000 JPY (not ideal, but no cheaper Shibuya options in the data; adjust threshold if needed)
    - Requirements: `null` (no Japanese requirement specified)
    - Type: Apartment
  - **Implementation Notes**:
    - Since the data has limited Shibuya properties and high prices, consider expanding the dataset or relaxing the price filter.
    - Use regex or string matching for "Shibuya-ku" in `address.full`.
    - If `requirements` is often `null`, treat it as allowing non-Japanese speakers unless specified otherwise.

#### 3. Query: "Spacious high-floor apartment near a station in Tokyo"

- **User Intent**: Find a large apartment on a higher floor with good station access.
- **Relevant Data Fields**:
  - `area.m2` (to match "spacious," e.g., ≥ 70 m²)
  - `floor` (to match "high-floor," e.g., above 5th floor)
  - `nearest_stations.walk_time_min` (to match "near a station," e.g., ≤ 10 min)
  - `type` (to ensure it’s an "Apartment")
  - `address.full` (to confirm Tokyo location)
- **How It Works**:
  - **Text Embedding**: Combine `address.full`, `type`, and `floor` (e.g., "Apartment on 22F in Hirai, Edogawa-ku, Tokyo"). Embed query and properties.
  - **Semantic Matching**: Match query embedding ("Spacious high-floor apartment near a station") to property embeddings.
  - **Structured Filters**:
    - `area.m2 >= 70`
    - `floor` contains a number ≥ 5 (parse floor string, e.g., "22F (of 29F)" → 22)
    - `nearest_stations.walk_time_min <= 10`
  - **Example Match**: Property with `id: "164433"`:
    - Address: "5-17-7 Hirai, Edogawa-ku, Tokyo"
    - Area: 77.26 m²
    - Floor: 22F (of 29F)
    - Nearest Station: Hirai Station (2 min walk)
    - Type: Apartment
    - Monthly Total: 390,000 JPY
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Parse `floor` field to extract the floor number (e.g., use regex to extract "22" from "22F (of 29F)").
  - Sort results by `walk_time_min` to prioritize closer stations.
  - Use `area.m2` as a primary filter for "spacious."

#### 4. Query: "New apartment in a quiet area with a balcony"

- **User Intent**: Find a recently built apartment in a less busy Tokyo ward with a balcony.
- **Relevant Data Fields**:
  - `year_built` (to match "new," e.g., ≥ 2024)
  - `address.full` (to infer "quiet area," e.g., avoid central wards like Shibuya or Minato)
  - `balcony` (to check for balcony presence)
  - `type` (to ensure it’s an "Apartment")
- **How It Works**:
  - **Text Embedding**: Combine `address.full` and `type` (e.g., "Apartment in Funabashi, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo"). Embed query and properties.
  - **Semantic Matching**: Match query embedding ("New apartment in a quiet area") to property embeddings, prioritizing non-central wards.
  - **Structured Filters**:
    - `year_built >= 2024`
    - `balcony != null` (though in the provided data, `balcony` is always `null`; assume future data may include this)
    - `address.full` contains wards like Setagaya, Edogawa, or Bunkyo (less busy than Shibuya or Minato)
  - **Example Match**: Property with `id: "176782"`:
    - Address: "2-3-7 Funabashi, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo"
    - Year Built: 2024
    - Type: Apartment
    - Monthly Total: 190,000 JPY
    - Balcony: `null` (no match for balcony in current data; adjust filter if balcony data is added)
  - **Implementation Notes**:
    - Define a list of "quiet" wards (e.g., Setagaya, Edogawa) versus "busy" wards (e.g., Shibuya, Minato) for filtering.
    - Since `balcony` is `null` in the data, consider adding this field or using `unit_notes` or `features` for balcony information.
    - Use `year_built` as a primary filter for "new."

#### 5. Query: "Luxury apartment in Minato-ku with good transport links"

- **User Intent**: Find a high-end apartment in Minato-ku with proximity to multiple stations.
- **Relevant Data Fields**:
  - `address.full` (to match "Minato-ku, Tokyo")
  - `price.rental.monthly_total` (to infer "luxury," e.g., ≥ 500,000 JPY)
  - `nearest_stations` (to match "good transport links," e.g., multiple stations within 15 min)
  - `type` (to ensure it’s an "Apartment")
  - `year_built` (to infer "luxury," e.g., recent construction)
- **How It Works**:
  - **Text Embedding**: Combine `address.full`, `type`, and `nearest_stations.station_name` (e.g., "Apartment in Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo near Omotesando Station"). Embed query and properties.
  - **Semantic Matching**: Match query embedding ("Luxury apartment in Minato-ku") to property embeddings.
  - **Structured Filters**:
    - `address.full` contains "Minato-ku"
    - `price.rental.monthly_total >= 500,000`
    - `nearest_stations` array length ≥ 2 (multiple stations)
    - `year_built >= 2020`
  - **Example Match**: Property with `id: "177020"`:
    - Address: "2-20-11 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo"
    - Monthly Total: 700,000 JPY
    - Nearest Stations: Omotesando Station (9 min), Nogizaka Station (14 min)
    - Year Built: 2022
    - Type: Apartment
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Use `price.rental.monthly_total` as a proxy for "luxury" (higher price = more premium).
  - Count `nearest_stations` entries to ensure good transport links.
  - Optionally, boost properties with `features.unit` or `features.building` if populated in future data (e.g., "concierge" or "gym").

### Implementation Guidance for Semantic Search

To execute these queries, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Text Fields**: Combine relevant text fields (e.g., `address.full`, `nearest_stations.station_name`, `type`, `unit_notes`, `requirements.note`) into a single string per property for embedding.
   - **Numerical Fields**: Store `area.m2`, `price.rental.monthly_total`, `year_built`, `nearest_stations.walk_time_min`, and `floor` number for filtering.
   - **Geospatial Data**: Index `address.latitude` and `address.longitude` for location-based queries (e.g., radius search).
2. **Embedding**:
   - Use a pre-trained model like `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (lightweight and effective for English/Japanese text).
   - Embed the combined text string for each property and store vectors in a vector database.
   - Embed user queries at runtime for similarity matching.
3. **Search Pipeline**:
   - **Semantic Search**: Retrieve top-k properties based on cosine similarity between query and property embeddings.
   - **Filtering**: Apply structured filters (e.g., `area.m2 >= 80`, `price.rental.monthly_total <= 300,000`) to refine results.
   - **Ranking**: Combine semantic similarity scores with filter criteria (e.g., boost properties with lower `walk_time_min` or higher `year_built`).
4. **Tools**:
   - **Vector Database**: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Faiss for storing and querying embeddings.
   - **NLP Library**: Hugging Face Transformers for embedding text.
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial queries or Elasticsearch for hybrid search (text + filters).
5. **Handling Japanese**: Since the data includes Japanese addresses and some properties require Japanese (e.g., `requirements.japanese_required`), use a multilingual embedding model (e.g., `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`) to handle English and Japanese queries.

### Notes and Limitations

- **Data Gaps**: Fields like `bedrooms`, `balcony`, `features.unit`, and `features.building` are often `null` or empty, limiting their use in semantic search. Consider enriching the dataset with these details.
- **Price Range**: The provided data has rentals from 190,000 to 700,000 JPY. For "affordable" queries, adjust thresholds based on your dataset’s distribution.
- **Station Lines**: The `nearest_stations.lines` array is empty in the data, which limits transport-related queries. If possible, populate this field with train line names (e.g., "Ginza Line").
- **Balcony and Amenities**: Since `balcony` and `unit_notes_amenities` are `null` or empty, queries involving these features may need alternative data (e.g., parse `unit_notes` or add new fields).
- **Scalability**: For larger datasets, optimize the vector database for fast retrieval and use approximate nearest neighbor search (e.g., HNSW indexing in Faiss).
